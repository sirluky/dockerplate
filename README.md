# DockerPlate
- Easily generate Dockerfiles and Docker-Compose for your project
### FAQ
#### Why are you making this tool ?, I can easily google dockerfile or write yourself
- You are right, you can google it, but it takes some time for you and not all dockerfiles you find on the internet are the most effective.

### What this CLI tool can do

- Generate dockerfile for programming language you choose.
- EXPOSE ports you choose, optional
- Generate both *development* and *production ready* dockerfile

### Challenging plans

- add special options for libraries and frameworks (e.g. Puppeteer, Laravel)
- Add options for generating Docker-compose files, with option to add a DBMS and other things which you may want to integrate with.
- detect the language and framework automatically and generate dockerfile for it.


### Addictions

- dockerized versions of this tool
- npm installation

## Challenging addictions

- VSCODE extension
- automatically generate .gitlab-ci or github-actions configuration
